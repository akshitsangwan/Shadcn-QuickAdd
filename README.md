# Shadcn QuickAdd

Shadcn QuickAdd is a web tool that allows you to install all shadcn components by selecting them. The purpose of this is to install multiple components at once, rather than installing them one by one.

By selecting the components, the tool generates a command for all supported package managers. All you have to do is copy and run it.
